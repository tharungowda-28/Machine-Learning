This Repository consists of two projecs. 
For both the projects the required datasets are attached respectively before running the projects, it is mandatory that the datasets are uploaded to the project file before they are executed.
Minor Project - This project processes various datasets to extract the desired outcomes from large volumes of data. It also aids in visualizing the data through graphs, plots, charts, and comparative graphs using Matplotlib.
Major Project - This project incorporates various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest. These models are designed to predict whether it will rain tomorrow based on the provided input data, trained using the uploaded CSV file. 
Additionally, the project includes testing the accuracy of these models to ensure they can predict the outcomes accurately.
